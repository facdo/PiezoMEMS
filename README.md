# PiezoMEMS

### Description
Scripts, simulations, ideas and documentation to the experiments with the PiezoMEMS chip.

### Goals
To access the potential of the PiezoMEMS chip for vibrational sensing and micro energy harvesting.

### Application Ideas
- WSN node for monitoring roads
  - Evaluate the vibrational spectrum of vehicles passing in a road.
    - [X] Calculate FFT of pressure impulses with gaussian wave format. Vehicle velocity associated with the standard deviation.
    - [ ] Simulate several vehicles, applying random noise to it.
    - [ ] Define the sensor parameters, relating the sensitivity to the pressure curve.
    - [ ] Evaluate the test cases where the sensor would work.
    - [ ] Optimize the sensor parameters for this application.
