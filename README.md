# PiezoMEMS

### Description
Scripts, simulations, ideas and documentation to the experiments with the PiezoMEMS chip.

### Goals
To access the potential of the PiezoMEMS chip for vibrational sensing and micro energy harvesting.

### Application Ideas
- WSN node for monitoring roads
  - Evaluate the vibrational spectrum of vehicles passing in a road.
  - [ ] Calculate FFT of pressure impulses with gaussian wave format. Vehicle velocity associated with the standard deviation.
